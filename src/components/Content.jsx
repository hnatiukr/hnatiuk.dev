        Hello! My name is Roman, I am software engineer from Ukraine, Kiev.
      </p>

      <p className='introduction_regular'>
        Despite a little experience in programming, I devoted many years to the
        development of computer programs and computer science. At the age of 14,
        he first made up a web application, and after a couple of years, he
        began working with first commercial projects.

      <p className='introduction_regular'>
        I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be
        websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always
        build products which arouse my interest and benefit society.
      </p>

      <p className='introduction_regular'>
        I understand that a programmer learns every day. My goal is to learn how
        to write any applications and sites, not specific ones. To be able to
        analyze a problem, formulate an algorithm for its solution, and only
        then implement this algorithm in code.
