				<h2>My name is <span class="selected">Roman Hnatiuk</span>, I am a programmer.</h2>

				<p>
					Of all the activities I do all the time, like walking the dog, visiting the cinema,
					playing football, travelling, and cycling, the most beloved is not present. Know what’s
					that? Writing code. Yeah, just like that!
				</p>

				<p>
					There is nothing cooler than the feeling of the program you just wrote being launched for
					the first time. And it works! It fills the terminal smoothly with lines of executing code.
					Not too fast, not too slow. Not too much, not too little. Not so long, but not instantly.
					With a slightly broken rhythm, a particle of randomness – like the vibrations of an atom.
				</p>

				<p>
					The process goes on. The work is done. And so it ended. Announced the answer. A moment
					ago, it was a simple set of code. And now, right here, you've created something that works
					better than you. And a simple set of instructions has become a tool. And you did it
					personally. Because you needed to organize something. Understand something. Something to
					streamline. And you have this power, in your hands, in your fingers. And this is more than
					a person can. And more than a computer can.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, yeah! Give me a terminal and a compiler. And I may not be turning the world upside
					down, but will surely be lost for at least a day. And the rest – it’s irrelevant.
				</p>

				<p>Here are a few technologies I am...</p>

				<ul>
					<li>working with: JS/TS (web front-end, web back-end)</li>
					<li>familiar with: Scheme/Racket, Python, Go (basic usage)</li>
					<li>learning now: Rust (web back-end)</li>
					<li>interested in: Clojure, OCaml, Haskell</li>
				</ul>
